This is hobby cagd library with the following functionality implemented so far
- splines (regular,periodic,rational).
- conic arc, circle, line.
- subdivide curve.
- split splines to bezier segments.
- extend splines.
- interpolate points to form splines (both periodic and regular)
- raise degree.
- insert knots.
- remove knot for curve fairing.

My plan is to read up text books Hoschek/Farin/Piegl and translate the book ideas into code as much as I can in here.
The project uses biicode to handle builds and catch to perform unit testing.
