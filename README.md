# asti 
This is cagd library with the following functionality implemented so far
- splines (regular,periodic,rational).
- conic arc, circle, line.
- subdivide curve.
- split splines to bezier segments.
- extend splines.
- interpolate points to form splines (both periodic and regular)
- raise degree.
- insert knots.
- remove knot for curve fairing.
- cubic and quad approximation
- distance of a point to a curve.
- arc lengths of curves.

[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/github/webhook?id=6omvn4e838alept8)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/svark/asti)

My plan is to read up text books Hoschek/Farin/Piegl and translate the book ideas into code as much as I can in here.
The project uses biicode to handle builds and catch to perform unit testing.
